abstract: |
  For valid preference elicitation, stated preference surveys must provide information on the good to be valued, and respondents must process and recall the information. Previous studies show that the amount and type of information can affect stated preferences and the validity of value estimates, but how respondents process this information has been less researched. Some studies find correlations between preferences and respondent engagement with the information, but our study is the first to randomly and exogenously manipulate factors of engagement in a stated preference survey. Drawing on stated preference guidance and psychological concepts, we estimate the effect of quiz questions (asking about the content of the information) and self-reference questions (asking how the information personally relates to the respondent) on (i) engagement, (ii) information recall, and (iii) stated preferences in a discrete choice experiment survey valuing the ecosystem services of urban gardens in the German cities of Berlin and Stuttgart. Our results indicate that respondents spend more time on the information page when confronted with quiz rather than self-reference questions. For both question types, we do not find effects on recall or stated preferences. The results suggest that questions which increase engagement with survey information may affect information processing less than previously assumed, highlighting the importance of testing the understanding and recall of important information in pretests.

# Introduction

Stated preference surveys are frequently used in environmental
economics to value non-market goods. However, the validity of their
estimates is debated. For example, it matters for stated preferences and the
validity of value estimates how information about the good to be valued
is provided to survey respondents [@blomquist_resource_1998;
@johnston_contemporary_2017]. Several studies show that more information
about the good can increase value estimates [e.g., @bateman_first_2004;
@hoevenagel_effects_1993; @vanermen2021; @rambonilaza2016non; @hoehn2002] and that different types of information can lead to differing stated preferences
[e.g., @ajzen1996; @czajkowski_controlling_2016; @Yang_2020]. @Munro_2001, and similarly @bergstrom1990impact, suggest that such effects on value estimates can be explained by expected utility theory if the provided information changes respondents’ beliefs about the benefits or the probability of provision of the environmental good.

For the provided information to affect beliefs and consequently stated preferences, the information needs to be processed by the respondents and recalled during
preference elicitation. Long-standing psychological literature
concludes that the depth of information processing matters for how well
information is retained and later recalled [@craik1972levels;
@van1988information]. In the context of stated preferences, a small
number of studies open this black box, investigating how respondents
engage with information and how this matters for stated preferences.
@balcombe2017examining and @ballco2019consumer use eye-tracking devices
to show that respondents with higher visual attendance to the
information have larger value estimates. Others find that stated
preferences differ between respondents who spend less or more time reading the information [@holmes1998effect;
@vista2009if; @tienhaara2020]. @berrens2004 and @tienhaara2020 show that
respondents who access optional links to additional information in
online experiments state a higher willingness-to-pay. Similarly,
@hu2009consumers find that respondents who voluntarily access additional
information choose different alternatives in a choice experiment than those who do not access this information. These previous studies on respondent engagement compare stated preferences between groups of respondents who differ in their engagement with the information according to observed indicators. However, due to potential endogeneity, this correlation does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between engagement and stated preferences. In particular, stated preferences and survey engagement are likely co-determined by underlying preferences. For example, respondents with strong preferences for the good to be valued could plausibly engage more with the information provided to them. At the same time, they could also exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay for this good. Our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate a potential causal effect of respondents' engagement with the information on stated preferences, which we explore by employing random exogenous manipulations as a causal identification strategy.

We insert two types of questions about the information directly after information provision and before preference elicitation to manipulate survey engagement and information processing. First, we follow @mathews2006and who suggest incorporating quiz questions that ask respondents about the content of the information into stated preference questionnaires to reinforce respondent comprehension. Similarly, @johnston_contemporary_2017 recommend supporting questions to engage respondents while they process presented information. However, we are  unaware of any previous empirical investigation of the effects of quiz questions in stated preference surveys. Second, psychology literature finds that self-reference questions lead to higher engagement with, and deeper processing of, the information compared to semantic questions, such as quizzes [@rogers1977self; @van1988information]. Self-reference questions are questions that ask how the information personally relates to the respondent, such as her previous experience, preferences or identity. By inducing deeper processing, self-reference questions can lead to a better recall of the information than quiz questions. In the experiments by @rogers1977self, subjects are twice as likely to correctly recall information when asked self-reference compared to semantic questions. In the context of stated preference surveys, deeper processing of information about the good to be valued, such as being potentially induced by quiz and self-reference questions, may strengthen respondents’ adaptation of beliefs in response to the information and, consequently, affect stated preferences. If respondents cannot recall the provided information about the good at the time of preference elicitation, this information would less likely affect the beliefs underlying their responses.

This paper investigates whether integrating quiz and self-reference questions in stated preference surveys (i) improves engagement with the information, (ii) increases recall of the information, and (iii) affects stated preferences. We analyze the extent to which these effects differ between quiz (recommended in the stated
preferences literature) and self-reference (recommended in the
psychology literature)  questions. We use data from a discrete choice experiment
survey that elicits preferences towards new urban gardens in the two German cities of Berlin and Stuttgart. The study was conducted in September and October 2020 with a sample of 1,686 respondents. In the preregistered study design[^1], respondents are randomly assigned to one of six versions of a questionnaire. The questionnaires differ in the amount of information provided and whether quiz, self-reference, or no questions
related to the information were posed.

[^1]: The research question, study design and
	empirical strategy were pre-registered in
	September 2020 before the start of data collection. We report all pre-registered analyses in this paper, but also engage in additional explorative analyses. The pre-registration is available under this link:
	\url{https://aspredicted.org/blind.php?x=2aq63r}. More details are provided at the end of the methods section.

Using ordinary least squares regressions, we investigate the effect of the manipulations on three outcomes: (i) time spent on relevant survey pages, (ii) correctly evaluated recall statements about the information after preference elicitation, and (iii) opt-out choices in the choice experiment. To analyze the effects of the manipulations on the willingness-to-pay estimates, we estimate a mixed logit model with treatment interaction terms. Additionally, we estimate a mixed logit model allowing willingness-to-pay to correlate with the time spent on the information page. This enables us to investigate whether the finding from previous studies that engagement and stated preferences are correlated can be replicated with our data. It also allows us to compare these potential correlations with the causal relations identified in the first mixed logit model with experimental manipulations.

We find that respondents confronted with quiz questions spend more time on the information page than those in the information-only and self-reference questions treatment. For both question types, we do not find large or statistically significant effects on recall or stated preferences, suggesting that questions about the provided information cannot easily reinforce the processing and recall of information. However, in accordance with previous studies [@holmes1998effect; @vista2009if; @tienhaara2020], we find statistically significant correlations between time spent on the information page and stated preferences. The two results indicate that the previously found correlations might reflect heterogeneity in respondent characteristics rather than a causal effect of engagement on stated preferences.


This study contributes to the stated preference literature in two ways: It is the first study to test empirically the recommendation to reinforce respondent engagement in stated preference surveys with quiz questions and the first to investigate how self-reference questions affect engagement and value estimates in stated preferences. Hence, our results inform recommendations concerning whether practitioners should include such questions when designing valuation surveys. Furthermore, our study is the first to use random exogenous manipulations of engagement with the information in stated preferences. This allows us to test whether the findings from previous research, namely that engagement with survey information correlates with stated preferences, is
causal. The results can shed light on how survey information affects stated
preferences as well as to what extent heterogeneity in engagement can explain preference heterogeneity among respondents.

# Data and experimental design

The first part of the questionnaire provided respondents with information on the two types of gardens studied and their attributes. This part included the treatments
used to answer this paper’s research question. In the following
part, respondents participated in a discrete choice experiment with eight
choice sets. Afterwards, respondents answered follow-up questions and evaluated eight recall statements testing their recall of the information provided before the choice experiment. The questionnaire ended with questions on
socio-demographic characteristics. We included a back button on each survey page so that respondents had the option to go back to previous pages.


## Information provision and treatments

We used six different questionnaire versions to implement the two-by-three between-subject experimental design. Respondents were randomly
assigned to one of the six versions. The versions only differed on one
survey page before the discrete choice experiment. This page first
provided information about two types of urban gardens, allotment garden
areas (*Kleingartenanlagen*) and community gardens
(*Gemeinschaftsgärten*). This information was seen by all respondents,
independent of the treatment to which they were assigned:[^2]

[^2]: The questionnaire was presented to respondents in German. All text
	described in this paper is translated to English by the authors.

*In Berlin/Stuttgart there are different types of gardens. This survey
is about gardens which are not only private, but where many people
can garden in.*

*Allotment garden areas are managed by an allotment garden association.
Members of the association cultivate private parcels individually.
There are public paths and spaces that can also be used by visitors.
There is often a community house.*

*Community gardens are managed jointly by a group of people. They may be
organized as an association, as a non-profit organization, or not
formally organized at all. The group together cultivates shared or
private patches. There is a shared garden area that is open to 
visitors.*

As part of our experimental manipulations, half of the respondents
received an additional paragraph on the same page providing information
about the benefits of urban gardens for the neighborhood:

*Allotment garden areas and community gardens not only provide
benefits for the gardeners, they also impact the neighborhood. They can
be used as a place for relaxation, meeting people, or enjoying nature.
Some allotment garden areas and community gardens have a public café or
a beer garden open to visitors. When it is hot, the green area cools the
surroundings, because it evaporates water and heats up less than
concrete or asphalt. Some plants in the gardens can retain pollutants
like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. This improves air quality.
The gardens also promote urban biodiversity, as they are habitats for
animals and plants, and connect adjacent habitats.*

The additional information paragraph was designed to mimic commonly used
information scripts which have a strong effect on stated preferences: The paragraph describes
the impact of urban gardens, but only covers their benefits. A non-use value, unfamiliarity and new information have been related
to strong information effects [@hoehn2002; @bateman_first_2004;
@hasselstrom2014] -- all these factors apply to some degree: The described benefits for biodiversity likely have non-use value for respondents. Community
gardens are rather unfamiliar to respondents, as only 24% of our respondents stated they had ever visited one. Most probably the information concerning the impact of
gardens on cooling and pollutant retention is also new for many
respondents.

At the bottom of the same survey page, we included the second experimental manipulation with three different versions. For a third of the respondents, the page ended after the
information. A further third of the respondents were asked three quiz
questions with yes and no as possible answers, as recommended by
@mathews2006and to reinforce comprehension. Finally, another third of the
respondents were asked three self-reference questions with yes and no as
possible answers. They were designed to be similar to the quiz questions
in structure and content to allow us to attribute any difference
to the type of question rather than the content.

The quiz questions read as follows:

*Can visitors also use allotment garden areas? yes/no*

*Can new gardeners participate in community gardens? yes/no*

*Is it only gardeners who benefit from allotment garden areas and
community gardens? yes/no*

The self-reference questions read as follows:

*Would you use a new allotment garden area in your neighborhood?
yes/no*

*Would you participate in a new community garden in your neighborhood?
yes/no*

*Would you personally benefit from a new allotment garden area or
community garden in your neighborhood? yes/no*

Figure \ref{fig:flow} summarizes the experimental
design and sample sizes per treatment. On the following pages, the survey provided respondents with detailed
information on six attributes of the gardens.[^3] These pages and the remaining part of the questionnaire were identical for all respondents.

[^3]: An English translation of the information on attributes can be found in Appendix G.

## Discrete choice experiment

In the choice tasks, respondents could choose whether they preferred an
allotment garden area or a community garden to be created in their
neighborhood. Each garden was characterized by a combination of levels
of the same six attributes, as presented in Table \ref{tab:attributes}.
The attributes included the size of the garden; its distance from the
place of residence of the respondent; the hosting of community
activities, cultural events and environmental education; the number
of days it is accessible for visitors; and its garden style. The monetary attribute was
defined as a compulsory yearly payment to a garden fund for every adult
resident of the city district. Respondents were informed that the money
would be exclusively used to subsidize the creation and maintenance of
new gardens.

The selection of attributes, their levels, and definitions were guided by
expert consultations with the city administrations of Berlin and Stuttgart in a workshop in January 2020 and bilateral follow-up
meetings with selected experts. In addition, four live chat focus groups with a total of 35 participants from the
general population of Berlin and Stuttgart were conducted in June 2020
to assess the relevance and understanding of potential attributes. The selected attributes were
tested in an online pretest with 100 respondents from Berlin in August
2020. Based on the results, some attribute descriptions were refined and the maximum level of the size and cost attribute reduced.

The discrete choice experiment consisted of a sequence of eight choice
tasks. Each choice task included one alternative labeled as an allotment
garden area and one alternative labeled as a community garden. Respondents
were asked to choose their most preferred option. Respondents
could also indicate that they did not want to create either of the two gardens (opt-out).
Figure \ref{fig-excs} shows an example choice task.

#| label: fig-excs
#| fig-cap: "An example choice task" 

knitr::include_graphics("figures/Figure_1.PNG",dpi=100)


```
The design includes 32 choice tasks split into four blocks. Each
respondent was randomly assigned to one block of eight choice tasks. The order
of the choice tasks from the respective block was randomized within
subjects, and each respondent received attributes in a random (but
constant for the respondent) order. The design was created with the Stata module dcreate,
using the Fedorov algorithm to maximize the D-efficiency for dummy coded
attributes in a multinomial logit model with priors taken from the pretest
[@hole2017dcreate]. The pretest design was an orthogonal array with the same number of choice sets and blocks.


## Follow-up questions and recall statements


After the discrete choice experiment, respondents answered questions on
choice certainty, perceptions of survey consequentiality and
credibility, and their reasons for choosing the opt-out option. This was
followed by eight statements about the information provided on the page,
including the treatments. For each statement, respondents could
choose between the options "correct", "false", or
"don't know".

There were two statements on the paragraph about allotment garden areas:

*Allotment garden areas can only be entered by members.*

*Only members of the allotment garden association can have a parcel in
allotment garden areas.*

Moreover, there were two statements on the paragraph about community gardens:

*Community gardens can only be entered by members.*

*Community gardens are always managed by an association.*

Finally, there were four statements on the additional information about the
impact of the gardens on the neighborhood:

*Cafés and beer gardens in allotment garden areas and community gardens
are only for members.*

*Allotment garden areas and community gardens connect adjacent habitats
for animals and plants.*

*The plants in allotment gardens and community gardens retain nitrogen
oxides.*

*When it is hot, gardens warm the surroundings because they heat up more
than concrete or asphalt.*

We use the respondents' number of correctly evaluated statements as an indicator to assess the extent to which respondents after the choice experiment recall the information that was provided before the choice experiment.

## Survey implementation

The survey was implemented online and
administered by a professional public opinion polling agency from
September to October 2020. A total of 1,084 respondents from Stuttgart and 602
respondents from Berlin completed the questionnaire. Participants were
recruited via two modes, where 507 respondents from Stuttgart and
all 602 respondents from Berlin were drawn from a panel that the polling
agency recruited offline without the possibility of self-enrollment. To
increase the sample size in Stuttgart, letters with a brief invitation to the survey and links to the online
questionnaire were sent in September via mail to a sample of 11,000 home
addresses selected randomly from the official registry of the city of
Stuttgart, and 577 additional respondents completed the questionnaire after
receiving this postal invitation.

Table \ref{tab:soziodem} shows socio-demographic characteristics of the
respondents, separated into the six samples of the two by three study
design. Differences between the samples are not statistically significant for any socio-demographic variable in Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-squared tests (p-values between 0.26 and 0.98).

# Methods

Our analysis is based on two different modeling approaches. First, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions to regress i) time spent on relevant survey pages, ii) the number of correctly evaluated recall statements, and iii) the number of opt-out choices on the treatment variables and selected control variables. These models show how the treatments and respondent characteristics affect survey engagement, information recall and stated preferences. Second, for a more nuanced picture of the effect on stated preferences, we estimate willingness-to-pay values for the attributes in the choice experiment with mixed logit models. The first mixed logit model with treatment interactions tests how our treatments affect willingness-to pay-values. The second model with time interactions tests for correlations between engagement and stated preferences to enable a comparison with the results of previous studies [in particular, @holmes1998effect;
@vista2009if; @tienhaara2020]. Table \ref{tab:factors} shows the coding of the manipulations that are used in the same fashion in all models investigating their effects.

## Specification of OLS models

We estimate five OLS models which differ only in the dependent
variable. The model takes the form


```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:struct}
\begin{multlined}
Y=\alpha+\beta_1*INFO+\beta_2*QUIZ+\beta_3*SELF \\ +\beta_4*INFO*QUIZ+\beta_5*INFO*SELF  + \symbf{\gamma*CONTROL} +\epsilon
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}
```

where $Y$ is the dependent variable being i) time in seconds spent on the screen with information about the two types of urban gardens, ii) time in seconds spent for the total questionnaire excluding the screen with information, iii) time in seconds spent on the choice experiment, iv) the number of correctly evaluated recall statements about the information ranging from zero to eight (as indicator for information recall), and v) the number of opt-out choices ranging from zero to eight. The variables INFO, QUIZ and SELF
are the manipulations described in Table \ref{tab:factors}.
${CONTROL}$ is a vector of control variables, including age, gender,
education, mode of recruitment as well as the usage of allotment gardens and community
gardens. The latter two are included as we expect that people who use
these gardens are already familiar with urban gardens and most
interested in the subject. The $\beta$s are parameters to be estimated,
measuring the impact of the manipulations on the dependent variable, and
${\gamma}$ is a vector of parameters for the control variables.
Finally, $\epsilon$ is a normally distributed and independent and identically distributed error term.

## Mixed logit model with treatment interaction terms

We use a mixed logit model with interaction terms to estimate the effect
of our manipulations on stated preferences. To understand individuals'
preferences disclosed through choices in the choice experiment, we apply
the random utility framework [@mcfadden1974] and represent the utility
of individual $i$ as


```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:util}
 U_i= \symbf{\beta_i' X}+ \symbf{\beta_{T}'XT} +\beta_{iC} C+\epsilon_i
\end{equation}
```

where $U_i$ is the utility of respondent $i$, $X$ is a vector of the
alternative-specific constants for allotment and community gardens, as
well as the non-monetary attributes; $C$ is the cost attribute; $T$ is a
vector of binary treatment variables as defined in Table
\ref{tab:factors}; and $\epsilon_i$ is an independently and
identically-over-all alternatives Extreme Value Type I distributed error
term. The parameters $\beta_i$ and $\beta_{iC}$ measure the impact of a
one-unit change in $X$ and $C$ on utility. Differences in preference
parameters between the treatment groups are captured by the parameters
of the interaction terms, namely by $\symbf{\beta_{T}}$.\
The parameters which are indexed over $i$ are random parameters,
following a predefined distribution. The mean value of the distribution
reflects the mean preference while the standard deviation indicates how
heterogeneous preferences are within the sample. An index for time, capturing the panel structure of the data, is omitted for readability.

The interpretation of the parameters is limited, as utility has no
specified unit of measurement. Hence, we use willingness-to-pay, which
is defined as the negative ratio of the parameter of attribute $k$,
$\beta_{ik}$, and the cost parameter, $\beta_{iC}$; that is,
$w_{ik}=-\frac{\beta_{ik}}{\beta_{iC}}$, where $w_{ik}$ can be
interpreted as the marginal willingness-to-pay for attribute $k$. To
ease the interpretation of the model estimates, we estimate our model directly in
willingness-to-pay space [@Train2005]. The willingness-to-pay space
model is a reparametrization of Equation \eqref{eq:util}. Each
non-monetary parameter is multiplied by
$\frac{-\beta_{iC}}{-\beta_{iC}}$ so that each estimated parameter
reflects the willingness-to-pay $-\frac{\beta_{ik}}{\beta_{iC}}$, rather
than the effect on utility $\beta_{ik}$.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:util3}
 U_i= -\beta_{iC}(\symbf{w_i'X}+\symbf{w_{iT}'XT}-C) + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
```
All $w$ parameters are assumed to be normally and $\beta_c$
log-normally distributed. This model can be estimated with the maximum simulated
likelihood method [@Train2005].


## Mixed logit model with time interaction terms

Some  empirical studies investigate the relation between stated preferences and engagement with survey information measured in time spent on relevant survey parts. [@holmes1998effect; @vista2009if; @tienhaara2020]. In contrast to our approach based on experimental manipulations, these models do not reliably identify causal relationships due to potential endogeneity, such as stated preferences and survey engagement being co-determined by underlying preferences. We estimate a mixed logit model with time as an indicator for engagement. This allows us to investigate whether we can find (not necessarily causal) correlations between engagement and stated preferences, as in previous studies, and compare whether these relationships hold up in the causal model with treatment interactions described above.

Our modelling approach is borrowed from one of these studies [@vista2009if] [^4]. We estimate a heteroscedastic mixed logit model with the alternative specific constant and each attribute interacted with the time spent on the information screen before preference elicitation. Allowing for heteroscedasticity in time shows how people who spend more or less time reading the information differ in their level of attention to the choice sets, and thus in the randomness of their choices.

[^4]: Our model differs from @vista2009if in some ways: (i) We use a continuous time variable instead of a binary cut off. (ii) We interact the time variable with all attributes and the alternative specific constants (ASC), instead of only the ASC. (iii) We estimate a mixed logit model to use the same specification as our first model, instead of a conditional logit model.

For better interpretation of coefficients, we divide time by 10 (i.e., a one unit increase in time corresponds to 10 seconds) and estimate the model in WTP space. To avoid confounding with the
treatment effects, we use as the time variable its deviation from the treatment means ($time -
mean(time_{Treatment})$). Heteroscedasticity  is operationalized
by modelling the scale parameter $\lambda$ as $\lambda= exp(\phi*Time)$,
whereas $\phi$ is a parameter to be estimated [@hensher1998combining;
@deshazo2002designing], entering utility as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:util4}
 U_i= exp(\phi*Time) * -\beta_{iC}(\symbf{w_i'X}+\symbf{w_{iTime}'X}*Time-C) + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
```

The specification is similar to the mixed logit model described above with the difference that we multiply utility with $\lambda$, and that the interaction terms are formed with the time spent on the information page ($Time$), rather than the treatments.
 The parameters of the interaction terms indicate the relation between time spent on the information page and stated preferences, and $\phi$ indicates how the error variance varies with $time$.


## Pre-registered analysis and outcomes
We pre-registered key outcomes and steps of our analysis [^5]. All six experimental conditions described above were part of the pre-registration. We defined the time spent on the information page, the number of correctly evaluated recall statements, the number of opt-out choices and the willingness-to-pay for the attributes as our main outcomes for engagement, recall and stated preferences, respectively. We also specified OLS regressions and mixed logit models in willingness-to-pay space. We did not, however, pre-register the mixed logit model with time interactions that we use to explore the relation between time and stated preferences found by previous studies.

# Results

## Effects on engagement

Appendix A presents OLS estimates predicting the time spent on the survey screen that provided information and treatments. Trivially, respondents spend more time on the screen if it contains one of the manipulations. However, it is notable that respondents who answer quiz questions spend on average statistically significantly (p<0.001) more time (65 seconds) than those who answer self-reference questions (50 seconds). This is an indication that the quiz questions induce stronger engagement with the information screen than self-reference questions.

Appendix B presents OLS estimates predicting the total time spent on the questionnaire excluding the screen with information and treatments, and Appendix C OLS estimates predicting the time spent on the choice sets. The results reveal whether the treatments have a spill-over effect on the time spent on other parts of the questionnaire. For example, respondents may compensate for the time spent on the information page by rushing other parts in the questionnaire, or more information may lead to a generally longer engagement with the questionnaire. However, the results indicate that there is no large spill-over effect.

## Effects on information recall

Table \ref{tbl-model_2_output} presents OLS estimates of the number of
correctly evaluated recall statements about the information. Model 1 includes
the experimental manipulations, while Model 2 adds socio-economic covariates
(vector $\mathbf{CONTROL}$ in equation \eqref{eq:util} above). Respondents evaluated on average 6.2 of the eight statements correctly. Note that this implies respondents knew the correct answer in, on average, around half of the cases, because they would have guessed correctly by chance in two of the remaining four statements. In contrast
to the time spent on the screen, the manipulations only have small and mostly statistically insignificant effects on correctly evaluated statements. However, socio-economic covariates play a major role in correctly
evaluating statements about the information. Younger
respondents, more educated respondents, and respondents who regularly
use community or allotment gardens are more likely to evaluate the
statements correctly. The magnitude of some of these estimates outweigh
the treatment effects. Respondents who regularly use allotment gardens
give on average 0.4 more correct responses which is more than what can
be achieved by adding questions or information. The recruitment method had
no impact on the number of correct answers. In Appendix D, we provide output from a Poisson and a Negative Binomial regression model as additional robustness tests. The models find neither large nor statistically significant treatment effects.

## Effects on stated preferences


To estimate the effect of our manipulations on stated
preferences, we estimate 1) an OLS model predicting the number of opt-out
choices and 2) a mixed logit model in willingness-to-pay space with the
treatment variables as interaction. While the OLS model reveals the
effect of our manipulations on choosing one of the gardens in general,
the mixed logit model details the effects on the willingness-to-pay for specific
attributes.F

Table \ref{tbl-model_3_output} reports results from an OLS model with the
treatment variables (Model 1) and with additional covariates (Model 2).
The models have very low predictive power as indicated by an adjusted $R^2$ of 0.00 and 0.05 respectively. The intercept indicates that, on average, a respondent
opts out in 2.5 of eight choice situations. The effects of
all treatment variables are not statistically significant and very small,
ranging from 0.01 to 0.23. In contrast, some of the control
variables are statistically significant. An increase
in age by ten years increases the
number of opt-out choices by nearly 0.3. People not using allotment gardens
and community gardens opt out nearly one time more often than people who use them. Overall, the models indicate that the additional
information, as well as the quiz and self-reference questions, have no
effect on how often respondents opt out in the choice experiment. Appendix D shows output from four different count data regression models as robustness tests, and the models show neither large nor statistically significant treatment effects.

Table \ref{tab:model_5_output} presents the results of the mixed logit
model in stacked form. The model was estimated in R 4.1.2, using the
apollo package version 2.6 [@hess2019apollo]. The first two columns report the mean
and standard deviations of the normally distributed random parameters of
the attributes' main effects, respectively. They indicate the mean
willingness-to-pay for a one unit increase and its estimated standard
deviation for respondents who have received no additional information or
questions, i.e., the baseline. The following columns report the
interaction effects with the different treatments, expressed in
additional willingness-to-pay compared to the baseline. The last two columns are three-way
interactions between the attributes, the information text and the quiz
or self-reference questions. A positive sign of the interaction
parameters implies a higher estimated willingness-to-pay among the
respondents in the respective treatment groups compared to the baseline.

The estimated mean parameters of the main effects have the expected
signs, and most parameters are highly statistically significant. The
willingness-to-pay for a new community garden in the neighborhood (ASC
(alternative-specific constant) community garden) is twice as high as
for a new allotment garden area (ASC allotment garden) at
approximately 60 Euro per year compared to approximately 30 Euro per
year. An increase in the distance from the respondent's residence to the
garden by one kilometer reduces willingness-to-pay by 20 Euro, and the
presence of cultural events or environmental events increases
willingness-to-pay by almost 15 Euro. An additional day of public access
increases willingness-to-pay by 5 Euro and a natural garden
layout compared to an orderly layout increases it by 20 Euro. The size of the
garden and the presence of community activities have no statistically
significant effect. Note that all standard deviations are highly
significant and larger than the means. This implies a high degree of
preference heterogeneity, with a considerable share of respondents even exhibiting negative willingness-to-pay. This may be an indication of some respondents valuing the opportunity costs of using space in their neighborhood for a new garden more highly than its benefits.

There are no statistically significant
interaction effects at the 5% level, i.e., we cannot confirm any shift in stated
preferences caused by our manipulations. We have validated the findings
by estimating various model specifications including separate models for
each treatment. In all models, we obtain similar results. [^6] To jointly
assess explanatory power of the treatments, we use likelihood ratio
tests to compare the improvements in terms of model fit over a mixed
logit model in WTP space without any treatment interactions (see Appendix E for model results), for i) the model with all interactions as reported in Table \ref{tab:model_5_output}, ii) a model with interactions indicating whether additional information was presented,
and iii) a model with interactions indicating which question type was
presented. The results are presented in Appendix F.

[^6]: We also estimated a model with alternative-specific attribute
	parameters to control for potential differences in the good to be
	valued. While people are more familiar with allotment gardens, which
	have a long tradition in Germany, the concept of community gardens
	is rather new. Hence, additional information might have a particular
	effect on the preferences for community gardens. However, we did not
	find any statistically significant differences in the interaction
	effects between allotment garden and community garden parameters.




The test indicates that model fit does not improve for the model with
all interactions or, the model with the interaction with the additional information. An
improvement in model fit is only present for the model with only question
interactions (at a 1% significance level).


## Correlation between engagement and stated preferences

Table \ref{tab:mixedtimeinthet} shows the results for the mixed logit model allowing for correlations between time spent on the information page and both willingness-to-pay and error variance. Mean willingness-to-pay values for the attributes are similar to mean willingness-to-pay in the mixed logit model without any interaction terms (see Appendix E). The small and insignificant parameter $\phi$ indicates no correlation between time and error variance. In contrast, some interaction terms with willingness-to-pay are significantly different from zero.  Respondents who spend more time on the information page than the treatment mean are willing to pay less for a new community garden or allotment gardens (ASC), holding all other attributes constant. Staying ten seconds longer on the information page translates into a 3 to 4 Euro lower willingness-to-pay. These amounts are, however, relatively small, taking into account the large heterogeneity between respondents’ willingness-to-pay for a new garden, as indicated by the standard deviations of 90 to 95 Euro. With respect to attributes, we find positive and significant correlations (5% significance level) for cultural events and near-natural garden layout. There is also a small negative correlation between time and distance (10% significance level). The remaining correlations are not statistically significant and relatively low in magnitude. A likelihood-ratio test (LR = 21.84; d.f. = 10; p = 0.02) shows that the model with time interaction terms has a better model fit than a simple mixed model without any interaction effects. These results indicate that, in our study, response time is correlated with stated preferences and value estimates, although not in a consistent direction and not throughout all attributes.

# Discussion and conclusions

One precondition for valid stated preference estimates is that
respondents have sufficient information on the good to be valued to make
informed choices. For the provided information to have the desired effect, it is
important to ensure that respondents process the information and recall
it during preference elicitation. While various studies investigated how
much and what type of information should be provided, there have been
few stated preference studies on the processing of information and these have
only identified correlations between engagement with the information and stated
preferences. Despite the absence of conclusive evidence, the stated
preference literature recommends the use of quiz questions to reinforce
respondent engagement. Psychology literature, in contrast, concludes that
self-reference questions are more effective.

In this paper, we used a two-by-three between-subject design in a choice
experiment on urban gardens to investigate the effect of quiz and
self-reference questions on engagement with the information, recall of the information, and stated preferences. We deployed six different questionnaire versions that differed in the amount of information and the presence of questions. Our study was the first to empirically test the recommendation to use quiz questions to reinforce information processing. Although we found that respondents confronted with quiz questions spend more time on the information page than those who are not asked any questions or are asked self-reference questions, we did not find statistically significant effects on recall and stated preferences. This suggests that including quiz questions about the provided information in stated preference questionnaires may be less helpful than generally assumed.

Although studies found self-reference questions to be more effective for enhancing information processing than semantic questions like quiz questions, in our case, respondents spend more time on the information screen when answering quiz rather than self-reference questions. We did not find statistically significant effects on recall or stated preferences, either. Different experimental settings may be a reason why we cannot replicate the effect of self-reference questions found in the original studies. The original studies tested the engagement with and recall of isolated words [e.g., @rogers1977self]. Our results suggest that these findings do not transfer to the setting of extensive information texts. The results do not provide evidence for recommending the inclusion of self-reference questions in stated preference surveys.

In our study, respondents seeing additional information on the benefits of urban gardens do not differ in their stated preferences. This contrasts with findings from numerous studies showing that
additional information about the good to be valued increases value
estimates [e.g., @hoevenagel_effects_1993; @Munro_2001;
@bateman_first_2004]. The information treatment in our study fulfills
characteristics that have been related to strong information effects to
some degree: Additional information is found to affect stated
preferences more if non-use values are important [@bateman_first_2004].
Urban gardens provide non-use values by promoting urban biodiversity as well as use value.
@bateman_first_2004 also find information effects to be stronger for
unfamiliar goods. Community gardens are rather unfamiliar to
respondents, as only 24% stated they had ever visited one, while
allotment gardens are familiar to most respondents. @hoehn2002 and
@hasselstrom2014 find that additional information affects predominantly
the stated preferences of those respondents for whom the information is
new. This might have limited the effect of our information treatment, as
even respondents without the additional information evaluated part of the recall statements correctly.

Particularly noteworthy is that the additional information does not increase the number of correctly evaluated recall statements, even though half of the statements were about the additional information. Some caution may be advised when constructing
stated preference surveys that rely on information text. While
information provision is a necessary precondition for informed choices,
in particular for unfamiliar goods, our findings call into question
whether the information is sufficiently processed and recalled in
preference elicitation. Questions or statements about the information,
similar to those that we employed after the choice task, could be used in
pretesting to assess whether necessary information is understood and recalled. If
not, alternative ways of providing important information like videos,
pictures or diagrams could be considered.

While we do not find treatment effects on stated preferences, we find significant correlations betweenstated preferences and the time spent on the information page, similar to the findings of previous studies [@holmes1998effect; @vista2009if; @tienhaara2020]. Our results suggest that the previously found correlations might reflect heterogeneity in respondent characteristics rather than a causal effect of engagement on stated preferences. This may impede enhancing information processing by enforcing engagement with the survey design. Instead, it is
important to think carefully about target populations and sampling, as
respondent characteristics such as sociodemographic variables and prior information can matter more for knowledge about the good than information provided in the survey.

To advance the question how to reinforce information processing in
stated preference surveys, more research is necessary. First, it would
be interesting to investigate manipulations of engagement
similar to ours in the context of different goods and valuation
scenarios, such as goods that provide exclusively non-use values or are
very unfamiliar to the respondents. Second, a more extensive
investigation of quiz and self-reference questions might produce a
more detailed picture of how such questions can be constructed to be  most effective. For
example, one could vary the number of questions, the difficulty of these
questions, and their position in the questionnaire. Third, the effect of
pictures, videos, animations and other information display formats may
affect the engagement with the information. The combination of these formats of information provision with questions can shed
some light on how information is processed in different formats and
whether these questions lead to improved engagement and recall. Finally, eye-tracking
can help to better understand the effect of quiz and self-reference
questions. One could, for example, investigate if people cross-check
their answers with the information provided.

\section*{Appendix D: Count models for quiz questions and opt-outs}

Table \ref{tbl-optoutquiz} and Table \ref{tbl-optoutcount} complement the OLS models investigating the effects of the treatments on the number of correct recall statements and the number of opt out choices. For correct statements, we estimated a Poisson and a negative binomial model. For the opt-out choices we estimated additional zero inflated and hurdle count models because these models account for large frequencies of zeros [@zeileis2008], which are present in this case. All in all, the results are consistent with the OLS results. There are no significant effects of the treatments on the number of correctly evaluated recall statements nor the number of opt out choices.

\section*{Appendix G: Translation of the attribute descriptions}

**Scenario**

Imagine there is unused land in your neighborhood where a new community garden or an allotment garden area could be created and consideration is being given to implementing such a new garden. It has not yet been determined what type of garden will be created. The new garden may differ in various features, which we will present on the coming pages. Assume you can help decide which garden will be created.


**Size of the garden**

Some community gardens and allotment garden areas are very small and have an area of only 500 square meters, for example. Others are large and have an area of 20,000 square meters, for example. For comparison, a soccer field is about 7,000 square meters.


**Neighborhood activities in the garden**

In some community gardens and allotment garden areas, activities are held for the gardeners and people from the neighborhood.
Environmental education events allow gardeners and visitors to learn together about nature in the garden and beyond. For example, knowledge about gardening, herbs and other plants, composting or insect hotels is imparted during workshops, courses, lectures, campaigns or school project days.
Cultural events in the garden can consist of, for example, concerts, films or readings for gardeners and visitors.
Community activities allow gardeners and visitors to meet and spend time together. These include summer parties, harvest festivals, communal cooking or baking, flea markets and days of action.


**Access for visitors**

Different community gardens and allotment garden areas also differ with respect to who can enter them and when.
Some are open every day for visitors from the neighborhood. The gates are always open and anyone interested can enter the community garden or allotment to take a look around, spend time or participate in activities.
Others are only open to visitors from the neighborhood on certain days. On the other days, the gates are closed and only members or tenants and their friends and family can enter the community garden or allotment.


**Garden style**

Different community gardens and allotment garden areas are designed and maintained differently.  
Some gardens are rather orderly: Beds are surrounded by flower strips or frequently mowed lawns. Other plants in the garden, such as bushes and hedges, are also often trimmed. Weeds and wild plants are quickly removed. There are no rock or deadwood piles. As a result, the garden provides little habitat for animals such as birds, insects, and small mammals.
Other gardens are rather natural: there are many naturally growing plants in the garden, such as meadows with grasses and wildflowers. Bushes and hedges are also cut less frequently. Weeds and wild herbs are allowed to grow to some extent. Sometimes there are rock or deadwood piles. As a result, the garden provides more habitat for animals such as birds, insects and small mammals.


**Distance from residence**

There are several possible sites where the new community gardens and allotment garden area could be located in your neighborhood. Some are very close to where you live, for example only 300 meters away. You will only need about 5 minutes to walk there. Others are further away, as far as 3 kilometers. You will need about 45 minutes to walk that distance.


**Yearly fee**

The creation and maintenance of new community gardens and allotment garden areas produce costs. A large part of these costs is borne by the gardens themselves. However, such gardens can be used not only by the gardeners, but also by the neighborhood, bringing benefits to other citizens such as a greener cityscape, neighborhood activities and a place to relax, meet people or enjoy nature.  

Since all citizens can benefit from the gardens, it would be conceivable that an additional part of the costs for creation and maintenance of the garden is borne by everyone, including you. Therefore, in the following scenario, an annual contribution for a garden fund is charged, which can range from 6 euros to 120 euros and exclusively funds the creation and maintenance of the new garden. If the garden is created, this fee will be paid by all citizens over the age of 18 in your district.
