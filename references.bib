	volume = {1},
	abstract = {This chapter provides an assessment of the state of research on framing, and examines how the concept of framing has been used across different disciplines. Using this overview, the authors explore two of the most common conceptual misunderstandings related to framing and their implications for political communication research. This includes an overview of the different approaches to framing in political communication research, more specifically, and of the relationship between framing and related effects models, such as priming and agenda setting. The authors conclude with a recommendation that framing research be redirected away from confounded “emphasis frames” toward “equivalence frames” in the original tradition by expanding the sample of potential frames to include nonverbal visual cues.},
